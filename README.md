# 🌎 Portfolio Website

My personal developer portfolio highlights recent work for the SorenLab and Earth Plus initiatives. It is built with **Next.js 14**, **TypeScript**, **Tailwind CSS**, and managed with **Bun**, then deployed to **Vercel**.

## 🧠 Overview

This site is the central hub for my featured projects (Blog, Dashboard, CT-App), certifications, and professional details. The interface embraces the unified Soren dark theme — black base, dark blue accents, and green/red state indicators.

## 📦 Deployment on Vercel

| Setting | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Install Command | `bun install` |
| Build Command | `bun run build` |
| Output Directory | `.next` |

### Environment Variables

This portfolio does not require runtime environment variables. If you add integrations (analytics, forms, etc.), document the necessary variables here before deploying.

Custom Next.js configuration is currently unnecessary because all images are served from the local `/public` directory.
