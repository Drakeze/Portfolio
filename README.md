## 🧠 Overview

This portfolio acts as my central hub — linking to my featured projects (Blog, Dashboard, CT-App), certifications, and professional details.  
It reflects my focus on modern design, clean architecture, and the unified **Soren** dark theme (black base · dark blue accent · green/red for state indicators).
